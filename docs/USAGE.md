# kube-drift — Usage Guide

How to install `kube-drift`, declare a `DriftCheck`, and read the drift it detects. For an architectural overview see the [README](../README.md); for building and testing see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

<br/>

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (v1.16+) and `kubectl` pointed at it
- `make` and Go (only for the `make install` / `make deploy` build path)
- For a `Git` source: the cluster nodes must have outbound network access to the repository host

<br/>

## Install

Install the CRD and deploy the controller with the Kustomize path:

```bash
cd kube-drift
make install    # install the DriftCheck CRD
make deploy     # deploy the controller into the kube-drift-system namespace
```

Verify the controller is running:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-drift-system get deploy,pod
```

> **Note:** the Helm chart at `helm/kube-drift/` is currently **CRD-only** — it does not yet ship the controller Deployment/RBAC/Service templates, so `helm install` will not bring up the operator. Use `make deploy` (Kustomize) for now.

<br/>

## Concepts

A `DriftCheck` (`drift.somaz.io/v1alpha1`) declares one drift comparison:

- **`spec.source`** — where the *desired* manifests come from. Two backends in v0.1, both **plain YAML only**:
  - `ConfigMap` — manifests stored in a ConfigMap's data key(s)
  - `Git` — manifests in a Git repository, cloned at a `ref` and read from a `path`
- **`spec.target`** — narrows which live resources are compared (`namespaces`, `labelSelector`). Empty means each manifest is matched by its own group/kind/namespace/name.
- **`spec.interval`** — how often the check re-runs (default `5m`).
- **`status`** — the result: a per-resource `driftedResources[]` list, a rolled-up `summary`, `lastCheckedAt`, and standard `conditions`.

On each interval the controller loads the desired manifests, compares them against the live cluster via the [`kube-diff`](https://github.com/somaz94/kube-diff) engine, and records what drifted.

<br/>

## Example 1 — ConfigMap source

A `ConfigMap` source works out of the box, because the controller ships with read access to `configmaps` (see [RBAC](#rbac-for-non-configmap-kinds) for other kinds).

**1. Store the desired manifests in a ConfigMap:**

```bash
kubectl create configmap desired-manifests -n default --from-file=manifests.yaml=/dev/stdin <<'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
  namespace: default
data:
  key: desired-value
EOF
```

**2. Declare the DriftCheck:**

```yaml
apiVersion: drift.somaz.io/v1alpha1
kind: DriftCheck
metadata:
  name: driftcheck-sample
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    type: ConfigMap
    configMap:
      name: desired-manifests
      # namespace: default    # defaults to the DriftCheck's namespace
      # key: manifests.yaml    # omit to concatenate every key as a YAML stream
  target:
    namespaces:
      - default
  interval: 5m
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/driftcheck_v1alpha1_sample.yaml
```

Since `app-config` does not exist in the cluster yet, it surfaces as **new** (declared but absent). Create it with a different value and it becomes **changed**; create it identically and it becomes **unchanged**.

<br/>

## Example 2 — Git source

The desired manifests are cloned from a Git repository. Only **plain YAML** under `path` is loaded — there is no Helm or Kustomize rendering in v0.1.

```yaml
apiVersion: drift.somaz.io/v1alpha1
kind: DriftCheck
metadata:
  name: driftcheck-git
  namespace: default
spec:
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      url: https://github.com/somaz94/kube-drift.git   # anonymous clone (public repos only in v0.1)
      ref: main                                        # branch, tag, or commit SHA; omit for the default branch
      path: config/samples                             # sub-directory holding the manifests; omit for the repo root
  interval: 10m
```

- **`ref`** accepts a branch name, a tag, or a commit SHA. A non-default branch resolves via its `origin/<ref>` remote-tracking form.
- **`path`** is a sub-directory within the repository. Only `.yaml` / `.yml` files are parsed; other files are ignored.
- Clones are **anonymous** — private repositories are not yet supported.

<br/>

## Reading drift results

```bash
kubectl get driftchecks
# NAME                 DRIFTED   NEW   LAST CHECKED   AGE
# driftcheck-sample    0         1     10s            30s
```

The printer columns are `Drifted` (`summary.changed`), `New` (`summary.new`), `Last Checked`, and `Age`. For the full picture:

```bash
kubectl get driftcheck driftcheck-sample -o jsonpath='{.status.summary}'
#   {"changed":0,"new":1,"deleted":0,"unchanged":0}

kubectl get driftcheck driftcheck-sample -o jsonpath='{.status.driftedResources}'
#   [{"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"ConfigMap","name":"app-config","namespace":"default","status":"new"}]

kubectl describe driftcheck driftcheck-sample   # includes conditions and events
```

- **`status.summary`** — tally across every compared resource: `changed` / `new` / `deleted` / `unchanged`.
- **`status.driftedResources[]`** — only the resources that drifted (unchanged ones are omitted). Each `status` is `changed`, `new`, or `deleted`.
- **`status.conditions`** — a `Ready` condition, `True` on a successful evaluation or `False` with a reason on failure.
- **`status.lastCheckedAt`** — timestamp of the last completed evaluation.

Per-resource `status` meanings: `changed` (exists on both sides, differs), `new` (declared, missing live), `deleted` (live, never declared), `unchanged` (in sync).

<br/>

## Metrics

The controller exposes a Prometheus gauge per DriftCheck:

```
kube_drift_resources{driftcheck="driftcheck-sample", namespace="default", status="new"} 1
```

The `status` label is one of `changed` / `new` / `deleted` / `unchanged`. The metrics server is **secure** (HTTPS on port `8443`, requiring authentication/authorization), so scraping needs an authenticated client — e.g. a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` with a bearer token, or the built-in `kube-drift-metrics-reader` ClusterRole bound to the scraping identity.

<br/>

## RBAC for non-ConfigMap kinds

The controller only declares read access to `configmaps` by default. To compare other kinds (Deployments, Services, …), the operator's ServiceAccount needs read access to them. The simplest grant is the built-in `view` ClusterRole:

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding kube-drift-view \
  --clusterrole=view \
  --serviceaccount=kube-drift-system:kube-drift-controller-manager
```

Scope this down to specific kinds with a purpose-built ClusterRole for production. A broader read story is on the roadmap.

<br/>

## Troubleshooting

If a DriftCheck never reports drift, inspect its `Ready` condition:

```bash
kubectl get driftcheck <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq
```

| `Ready` reason | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `DriftEvaluated` (True) | The check ran successfully | — |
| `SourceError` (False) | Desired manifests could not be loaded — missing ConfigMap, bad key, missing `git` block, or empty `url` | Correct `spec.source` |
| `NoFetcher` (False) | The cluster fetcher was not wired (controller misconfiguration) | Check the controller logs |
| `CompareError` (False) | A transient comparison failure — API blip or a Git clone that timed out | Usually self-heals on backoff retry; check network/repo reachability |

Controller logs:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-drift-system logs deploy/kube-drift-controller-manager -f
```

<br/>

## Limitations (v0.1)

- **Plain YAML only** — Helm charts and Kustomize bases are not rendered (planned for v0.2).
- **Git is anonymous** — private repositories (credentials) are not yet supported.
- **No alerting** — drift is exposed via `status` and metrics only; Slack/webhook notifications are planned for v0.2.
- **ConfigMap read RBAC by default** — comparing other kinds requires granting read access at install time (see [RBAC](#rbac-for-non-configmap-kinds)).
